# Pipelined-Processor

###### Pipelined ARM processor designed and implemented in System Verilog. Hazard unit module used for addressing any hazards. Initially, processor was implemented as a single cycle ARM processor, then was pipelined for efficiency. Pipelining process consists of 5-stage pipeline and four registers. Testbenches written for simulation in ModelSim in order to ensure functionality of pipeline, processor, and hazard unit.
